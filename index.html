              <p>
                NASA is working on deploying humanoid robots to aid in space
                exploration, such as assisting astronauts in performing
                difficult or dangerous tasks. These robots are designed to
                handle extreme environments, like Mars or the Moon, where human
                presence is limited. Using AI and autonomous decision-making,
                these robots will enhance safety and efficiency in future space
                missions.

        <h1>What is Dopamine</h1>
        <h2>Dopamine: The Brain's Reward Chemical</h2>
        <p>
            Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in how we feel pleasure and reward. 
            It's often called the "feel-good" chemical because it helps regulate mood, motivation, 
            and reinforcement of behaviors. When you achieve something, whether it's eating a delicious 
            meal or receiving a compliment, dopamine levels rise, making you feel good and encouraging 
            you to repeat the behavior. It's also involved in movement and coordination, 
            and its imbalance is linked to disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 
            Essentially, dopamine helps drive our actions and keeps us motivated!
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>What means unhealthy dopamine</h1>
        <h2>Dopamine: The Brain's Reward Chemical</h2>
        <p>
            Dopamine, the brain's pleasure chemical, is essential for motivation and feeling good. 
            However, when dopamine levels become imbalanced, it can lead to significant problems. 
            Excessive stimulation, such as that from constant phone use and social media, 
            can cause unhealthy dopamine spikes. These platforms often create short bursts of pleasure, 
            leading to addictive behaviors and a cycle of craving more instant gratification. 
            This overuse can result in feelings of anxiety, depression, and diminished ability to experience 
            genuine satisfaction. On the flip side, low dopamine levels can cause apathy and lack of motivation. 
            Maintaining a balanced dopamine system is crucial for mental health and well-being.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = 'problems '>
        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <h2>Social Media</h2>
        <p>
            Social media platforms are designed to maximize engagement by providing frequent, 
            immediate rewards—likes, comments, and shares. Each notification triggers a dopamine release, 
            creating a cycle of instant gratification. This constant stimulation can lead to addiction-like behaviors, 
            where individuals crave more frequent and intense interactions to maintain the dopamine-driven pleasure. 
            Over time, this can contribute to decreased attention spans, increased anxiety, 
            and a distorted sense of self-worth based on online validation.
        </p>
        <h2>Smartphones</h2>
        <p>
        Smartphones are a major source of dopamine-driven behavior. From endless scrolling through apps to receiving 
        constant notifications, these devices keep users engaged with frequent dopamine hits. 
        This can result in decreased productivity, disrupted sleep patterns, and impaired real-life social interactions. 
        The constant need to check phones can also exacerbate feelings of anxiety and depression, 
        as users become reliant on their devices for emotional regulation.
        </p>
        <h2>Drugs</h2>
        <p>
            Drugs, particularly stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, can cause extreme spikes in dopamine levels. 
            This intense release of dopamine leads to euphoric highs, but also creates a strong cycle of addiction. 
            The brain's natural dopamine system becomes desensitized over time, requiring higher doses to achieve the same
            effect and leading to severe physical and psychological health issues. Long-term drug use can result in 
            significant cognitive impairments, mental health disorders, and difficulty experiencing pleasure from 
            everyday activities.
        </p>
        <h2>Overeating and Processed Foods</h2>
        <p>
            Consuming large quantities of high-sugar or high-fat processed foods can also disrupt dopamine levels. 
            These foods often provide quick bursts of pleasure by triggering dopamine release, which can lead 
            to cravings and overeating. The brain's reward system becomes overstimulated, reinforcing the cycle of 
            seeking more sugary or fatty foods for pleasure. Over time, this can contribute to unhealthy weight gain, 
            metabolic disorders, and a reduced ability to find satisfaction in healthier foods. Additionally, the constant
             search for comfort through food can be linked to emotional eating and other psychological issues.
